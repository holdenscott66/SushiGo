Sushi Go!
This project is for the class CPSC 233 Winter 2018 at the University of Calgary. This is specific to Winter 2018 Lecture 2 taught by Sohaib Bajwa.
Sushi Go! is a card game that involves creating card combinations based on hands and hands are switched each turn.

Getting Started
To get started you will need to download the game.zip file and extract the files into a folder. You will need to open up an IDE for java and 
make that folder the source folder. You will then go into the GUI.java file and run that file. The game will then begin.

Prerequisites
To play this game you'll need an OS that has Java installed along with its default packages. You will need an extractor that can extract zip files
and an IDE that can run java files.

Installing
Given that you have an OS that can run Java, you can download the lates Java version here:
https://java.com/en/download/

You can download the Eclipse IDE here:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/oxygen/R2/eclipse-inst-win64.exe

Once these two are downloaded, install them on your computer.
Open Eclipse and hit File > New > Java Project
Set the Project name to SushiGO and change the location to the folder that contains all the files from game.zip.
Then open the GUI.java in eclipse and run it.

We create boards for our humans with all our types of cards here and we check through our scoring method if it follows the rules of the game. We decided to write a tests on this because it's the most important part of our game. You should be rewarded accurately with the cards that you placed on the board. Through these tests we are able to see the accuracy of our scoring method and to see if it works correctly. We have a test for each of our 9 cards.

For example, in our Pudding test. We create two new Humans and add Puddings into their respective board. We add one for player1 and 0 for player2. According to the rules of the game, if you have less pudding then the other player. You get deducted 6 points.
